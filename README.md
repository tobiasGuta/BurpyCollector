# BurpyCollector
BurpyCollector is a Jython Burp Suite extension that automatically collects and deduplicates unique HTTP endpoints from Proxy traffic. It respects Burpâ€™s Target scope (or a custom host list), normalizes queries, and saves the results in JSON Lines format for easy parsing and recon use.
